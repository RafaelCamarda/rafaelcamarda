### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I had a promising and accelerated career where two points were always present. Technology and Education. 

Having worked from Dev to Sr Engineering Manager, I also have courses on Udemy with more than 1700 students, including the most successful Elixir course in Portuguese: https://www.udemy.com/course/elixir-e-phoenix-do-zero/. 

I value collaborative work environments, which form, which promote a good balance between personal and professional life.
